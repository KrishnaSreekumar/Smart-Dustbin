# Smart Garbage Management System using IoT
The Smart Dustbin is an Internet of Things (IoT) based system that aims to provide a solution for efficient waste management. NodeMCU, a low-cost Wi-Fi module that can be readily programmed using the Arduino IDE, is used to implement this project. The technology uploads the data to the cloud platform Thingspeak using ultrasonic sensors to measure the amount of trash in the dustbin. Users can access a web application or a mobile app to examine the dustbin's current state after the data has been processed and analyzed. When the trashcan is full, the system can transmit alarms, and it can also produce data to help the authorities keep track of the garbage collection procedure. This concept offers a workable waste management system that can help in creating a cleaner and healthier environment. The project demonstrates the potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) in creating intelligent systems that can solve real-world problems.
